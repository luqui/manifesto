Long goal: awesome structural editor library with a grammar for Haskell
Mid goal: equational reasoner for some simple language, e.g. lambda calculus + some junk
  Ouputs equality proofs for the edits
Short goal: Structural editor for a simple language, e.g. lambda calculus + infix operators
Proof of concept: Reproduce Sexp.hs in the new architecture

Possible next steps (in increasing order of difficulty estimate)
* Navigation
* Node-specialized commands
* Flesh out syntax/pretty printing API
* String editing
* Patterns & rewrites  (difficult bc of pattern parsing)
* Left-associative productions
* Associative operators
